>>>>>>> parent of 764810a (new minions (fast minion has more speed; tank minion has lots of hp but splits to 4 minions when it dies; pro/projectile minion shoots fire at the player, cool minion has 1 hp but explodes into harmful fire projectiles that can damage the player; and a dragon for any upcoming boss fight (Still fixing the pro and cool minions. The obj for the dragon has not been created yet)); fixed transitions to different rooms; edited the rooms a bit and made it so that nobody can go out of bounds; edited the score board to keep track of points, lives, and health; health starts at 50 and depletes when touching the enemy or getting hit by fire and restarts room/lose life when health reaches 0; and fixed the animation on the player by adjusting its hitboxes.)
